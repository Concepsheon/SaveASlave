    <p>The internet makes it possible for  anyone to give some happiness and help just by emailing this website.<br />
      <br />
Please send this website to others to help former sex slaves. It's a quick and  easy way to alert others about present day slavery and help in the fight for  freedom. <br />
<br />
Help is needed for Save A Slave to inform and educate the world about modern  day slavery and to encourage former slaves.<br />
<br />
Volunteer yourself to the anti-slavery community by e-mailing this website.  Tell your feelings to other websites. This can be dangerous as some people make  a living on the misery and pain of others. This can be done without giving a  gift to Save A Slave.<br />
<br />
Forwarding this website makes you a volunteer to Save A Slave.<br />
<br />
Feel free to forward this message to family and friends!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Educate yourself about modern day slavery. Encourage others by doing things  like developing anti-slavery meetings. Help others to end slavery, even if that  means only one slave at a time.<br />
<br />
The world ignores millions of slaves trapped in involuntary labor and  prostitution. There might be approximately 19,000 trafficked persons right here  in the United States.<br />
<br />
Those poor unfortunates, Trafficked migrants already here in the United States  are not physically chained but never the less are living and working under  constant fear of harm or harm to their family back home.<br />
<br />
These people of all ages and sexes are suffering criminal abuse.<br />
<br />
Because some people make a profit or living of the backs of these poor people,  helping to free slaves might be dangerous. Because of this potential danger, be  careful. A relationship might degenerate. Under certain circumstances your  actions can be interpreted as solicitation for prostitution. Be careful and be  safe.<br />
<br />
If you know of anything about a recently freed slave in need of a home or care.  Please help any way that you can legally, morally and ethically are able to.<br />
<br />
Please do whatever that you can, that is safe, tasteful and ethical as often as  you can, as much as you can to help this cause.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Whatever you post online is forever, so be careful.<br />
<br />
There is no lawyer here and no legal advice will be given out. Nobody can be  aware of thousands of laws, rules and regulations which are administered and  enforced by different federal departments and agencies. Every country, state or  territory has its laws, rules and regulations also.<br />
<br />
This is not affiliated with the United States Government and is not an official  U.S. government or approved by any entity of the United States Government. No  specific intent at affiliation or approval is intended or sought. This is not  an IRS tax exempt charity. It is only an idea to help the victims and survivors  of modern day slavery.<br />
<br />
Trafficking in persons, particularly women and children, is significant on  nearly every continent. Gauging the level of trafficking with precision,  however, is difficult since it is an underground industry. Estimates of the  trafficking problem in the United States vary, given differing definitions of  what constitutes trafficking and research based on limited case studies. At  present, no one US or international agency is compiling accurate statistics.  Nonetheless, government and nongovernmental experts in the field estimate that  out of the 700,000 to two million women and children who are trafficked  globally each year, 45,000 to 50,000 of those women and children are trafficked  to the United States. Approximately 30,000 women and children are being  trafficked annually from Southeast Asia, 10,000 from Latin America, 4,000 from the  Newly Independent States and Eastern Europe, and 1,000 from other regions. <br />
<br />
There have been reports of  trafficking instances in at least 20 different states, with most cases  occurring in New York, California, and Florida. Some Florida law enforcement  officials, for example, claim that the state is being inundated with trafficked  women from Russia, Ukraine, and Central Europe. INS and Labor Department  officials fear that the problem is not only bigger than they thought but also  getting worse. For example, INS has discovered over 250 brothels in 26  different cities, 6 of which likely involved trafficking victims. Evidence  suggests that state and local law enforcement officials appear to have only  scratched the surface of the problem. Trafficking cases are hard to uncover as  the crime usually occurs &quot;behind closed doors&quot;, and language and  cultural barriers usually isolate the victims.<br />
<br />
The primary source countries for the United States appear to be Thailand,  Vietnam, China, Mexico, Russia, Ukraine, and the Czech Republic. Women have  also been trafficked to the US from the Philippines, Korea, Malaysia, Latvia,  Hungary, Poland, Brazil, and Honduras among other countries. Women have been  trafficked to the US primarily for the sex industry (prostitution, stripping, peep  and touch shows, and massage parlors that offer a variety of sexual services),  sweatshop labor, domestic servitude, and agricultural work.<br />
<br />
Women have also been trafficked to provide maid services at motels and hotels,  peddle trinkets on subways and buses, and beg. The average age of the  trafficking victim in the United States is roughly 20 years old. Some of the  Asian women may have been initially trafficked overseas at a much younger age,  but then worked in cities such as Bangkok before being trafficked to the US. A  review of several illustrative trafficking and slavery operations  &quot;involving sweatshop, agricultural, and other forms of labor&quot; over  the last eight years shows that these operations went unnoticed or were able to  exist longer than trafficking operations involving the sex industry. Labor  trafficking operations generally lasted from 4 to 6 years whereas trafficking  operations for prostitution lasted from a little over a year to approximately 2  years before being discovered. Trafficking operations for other forms of the  sex industry, such as exotic dancing and peep-and-touch shows, were in  existence for anywhere from 10 months to 3 years. Once uncovered, trafficking  and slavery cases usually take about a year and a half to investigate and  prosecute, according to the Department of Justice's Involuntary Servitude  Coordinator in the Civil Rights Division, Criminal Section.</p>
