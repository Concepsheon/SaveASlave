<div class="wrap"><p>Women have also been trafficked to provide maid services at motels and hotels, peddle trinkets on subways and buses, and beg. The average age of the 
trafficking victim in the United States is roughly 20 years old. Some of the Asian women may have been initially
trafficked overseas at a much younger age, but then worked in cities such as Bangkok before being trafficked to the US. A review of several illustrative 
trafficking and slavery operations -involving sweatshop, agricultural,
and other forms of labor- over the last eight years shows that these operations went unnoticed or were able to exist longer than trafficking operations 
involving the sex industry. 
</p><p>Labor trafficking operations generally lasted from 4 to 6 years whereas trafficking operations for prostitution lasted from a little 
over a year to approximately 2 years before being discovered. Trafficking operations for other forms of the sex industry, such as exotic dancing and 
peep-and-touch shows, were in existence for anywhere from 10 months to 3 years. Once uncovered, trafficking and slavery cases usually take about a year 
and a half to investigate
and prosecute, according to the Department of Justice's Involuntary Servitude Coordinator in the Civil Rights Division, Criminal Section.
