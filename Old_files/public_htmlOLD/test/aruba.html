        <h1>Aruba <img src="images/countrymap/aruba-flag.jpg" align="right" /></h1>
     
      
      <p>Aruba*   is a destination and source country for women and men subjected to sex   trafficking and forced labor. Those at greatest risk continue to be   foreign women in Aruba&rsquo;s commercial sex trade, and foreign men and women   in the service and construction industries. Specific at-risk   communities include Chinese men and women working in supermarkets,   Indian men in the jewelry sector, and Caribbean and South American women   in domestic service. A 2013 international organization report   identified Aruba&rsquo;s regulated and unregulated prostitution sectors,   domestic workers, and small retail shops as the groups and sectors most   susceptible to trafficking. This report also noted some children may be   vulnerable to trafficking, including children providing sexual favors   and/or companionship for money and gifts; third-party prostitution of   children under the age of 18 is a form of human trafficking. The report   also noted a trafficking case involving an Aruban girl studying in the   Netherlands and media reports of Aruban women allegedly subjected to   debt bondage in the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>The Government of Aruba does not fully comply with the minimum   standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making   significant efforts to do so. The government made progress in its   anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts in 2013 by convicting two   trafficking offenders, marking the first convictions under Aruba&rsquo;s human   trafficking statute. The government has yet to formalize standard   operating procedures to guide all front-line responders in the proactive   identification of trafficking victims and their referral for care; its   approach to trafficking victim identification and protection remained <em>ad hoc</em>. The government did not initiate any new prosecutions during the reporting period.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommendations for Aruba: </strong></p>
      <p>Proactively identify trafficking victims among all vulnerable groups   in Aruba, including domestic workers, migrants in construction and   retail shops, and women in the sex trade and on adult entertainment   visas; formalize standard operating procedures on the identification and   referral of trafficking victims for all front-line responders; widely   disseminate these procedures to encourage their use by immigration   officials, NGOs, health workers, labor inspectors, and other officials;   vigorously investigate and prosecute trafficking offenses, and convict   and punish trafficking offenders; take steps to ensure that weekly   medical check-ups for foreign women in the regulated prostitution sector   include screening for trafficking indicators; systematically provide   information to all immigrant populations upon their arrival in Aruba so   they are familiar with their rights and where to go for help; provide   the anti-trafficking committee with an independent budget and provide   resources to enable the national coordinator to improve overall   anti-trafficking response; and develop ways to educate clients of the   sex trade about trafficking.</p>
      <p><strong>Prosecution</strong></p>
      <p>The Government of Aruba demonstrated significant progress in its   anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts by convicting and sentencing   two trafficking offenders in 2013. Aruba prohibits all forms of   trafficking in persons through Articles 203a and 286a of its criminal   code, which prescribe penalties for trafficking offenses ranging from   four to 15 years&rsquo; imprisonment. These penalties are sufficiently   stringent and are commensurate with those prescribed for other serious   crimes, such as rape. In November 2013, an Aruban court convicted and   sentenced two traffickers under Article 286a to five and four-and-a-half   years&rsquo; imprisonment, respectively. The court convicted the trafficking   offender who received four-and-a-half years&rsquo; imprisonment in <em>absentia</em>; the other perpetrator remains in prison.</p>
      <p>During the year, the government reported the referral of five new   suspected trafficking cases to the national anti-trafficking coordinator   for further action. Of these cases, the government initiated one new   trafficking investigation in Aruba involving one victim and at least two   alleged offenders. Authorities referred another investigation to   authorities in Bonaire. This represents an increase from the previous   year, when the government did not launch any trafficking investigations.   The government did not initiate any new prosecutions in 2013; two cases   from previous years remained pending. The government did not report any   investigations or prosecutions of public officials allegedly complicit   in human trafficking-related offenses. In an apparent conflict of   interest, security for sex trade establishments was reportedly sometimes   provided by off-duty police officers, which experts note could inhibit   law enforcement&rsquo;s willingness to investigate allegations of human   trafficking in the sex trade and could prevent victims from reporting   trafficking crimes. Aruban police officers reportedly also frequent the   services of women in prostitution, which could also deter victims from   coming forward. The government reported that adequate funding and   staffing for police remained an ongoing challenge. Aruba continued to   incorporate human trafficking awareness into the police academy   curriculum in 2013.</p>
      <p><strong>Protection</strong></p>
      <p>The Government of Aruba sustained its victim protection efforts in   2013. The government identified two potential trafficking victims during   the reporting period; the government identified one potential victim in   2012. The potential victim identified in connection with the Bonaire   case reportedly left Aruba before the case was reported. In the second   case, the government provided the victim with emergency shelter, food,   clothing, and financial and immigration assistance. The government had   informal, verbal agreements with local NGOs and private sector   accommodations for sheltering adult victims; the government lacked a   formal referral mechanism to guide officials on the identification of   trafficking victims and where to refer victims them for care. The   government reported victims were permitted to leave shelters   unchaperoned after conducting a risk assessment. Aruba&rsquo;s   anti-trafficking taskforce continued to provide law enforcement and   social services officials with a checklist of the 10 most common signs   of human trafficking. Although police and health department officials   inspected bars in Aruba with regulated prostitution, these inspections   did not include an assessment of trafficking indicators, nor were these   checks conducted during prime hours of operation. Further, although   labor inspectors reportedly inspected work sites where vulnerable   migrants were present, they did not undertake screenings for trafficking   indicators. The government reported that it encouraged trafficking   victims to participate in investigations and prosecutions of trafficking   offenders and did not charge victims for crimes committed as a direct   result of being trafficked. According to Aruban officials, the   government has the authority to provide identified trafficking victims   relief from immediate deportation and work permits for a maximum of six   months; however, it granted no such relief to any trafficking victims in   2013.</p>
      <p><strong>Prevention</strong></p>
      <p>The government sustained prevention efforts during the reporting   period. The anti-trafficking taskforce, via its national coordinator,   continued to coordinate Aruba&rsquo;s anti-trafficking efforts and prevention   activities in 2013. During the year, the taskforce began drafting a   2014-2018 action plan on human trafficking. The plan will incorporate   key findings and recommendations from an expert regional report   published in 2013 titled, &ldquo;A Situational Analysis of Aruba&rsquo;s Response to   Human Trafficking.&rdquo; The government partnered with IOM to produce the   donor-funded report, which resulted in increased transparency about   anti-trafficking efforts in Aruba. Aruba continued to promote a human   trafficking awareness campaign, which included posters and flyers in   four languages targeted to both victims and the general public and   linked to a hotline with operators trained to assist trafficking   victims. The government took no steps to reduce the demand for   commercial sex acts during the reporting period. There were no known   reports of child sex tourism occurring in Aruba or of Arubans   participating in international sex tourism.</p>
      
      <p><em>* Aruba is a semi-autonomous entity within the Kingdom of the   Netherlands. The Kingdom Charter divides responsibility among the   co-equal parts of the Kingdom based on jurisdiction. For the purpose of   this report, Aruba is not a &ldquo;country&rdquo; to which the minimum standards for   the elimination of trafficking in the Trafficking Victims Protection   Act apply. This narrative reflects how Aruba would be assessed if it   were a separate, independent country.</em></p>
